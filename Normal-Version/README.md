Grab the firmware for the PIC16F684 [here](https://github.com/borti4938/Switchless-Mods/tree/master/NES/IGR_for_NESRGB/)

-  current version: use the 'normal version' and flash the nesrgb_igr_684_var_led.hex
- oldest PCB version (with three 10k resistors next to the 74*125): use the 'risky version' and flash nesrgb_igr_684_risky_var_led.hex
